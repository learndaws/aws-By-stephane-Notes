Three main deployment models of cloud:

* Private Cloud
* Public Cloud
* Hybrid Cloud

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Five characteristics of Cloud computing:

* On-demand Selfservice
* Broad Network Access 
* Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
* Rapid elasticity and scalability
* Measured units

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Six advantages of cloud computing:

* Trade capital expense(CAPEX) over operational expence(OPEX) 
* Benefit from massive economies of scale
* stop guessing capacity
* Increase speed and agility
* Stop spending money running and maintaining the datacenters
* Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Four different types of cloud computing:

* infrastructure as a Service (Iaas) 
          Example from AWS : Ec2 instance
        Example from Others: Azure, GCP, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode

* Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
          Example from AWS : Elastic Beanstalk
        Example from Others: Heroku, Google App Engine(GCP), Windows Azure(Microsoft)

* Software as a Service (SaaS)
          Example from AWS : Many like Rekognition for Meachine Learning
        Example from Others: Google Apps(Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom

* Function as a Service (Faas)
          Example from AWS : Lambda
        Example from Others: "Need to update"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three pricing fundamentals of Cloud (Pay-as-you-go):

Computing - Pay for compute time
Storage - Pay for on the amount of data stored
Netowrking - Pay only for amount of outgoing traffic i.e., from cloud.. Amount of Incoming traffic data is free

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to choose the region for Application deployment:

* Based on Compliance with data governance and legal requirements
* Proximity to customers: Reduced latency
* Service availability in a choosen region
* Pricing of the region

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Four MFA device options in AWS:

* Virtual MFA device 
        Example: Google Authenticator from Google
                 Authy from AWS 
                
* Universal 2nd Factor(U2F) Security Key
        Example: Yubikey from Yubico (Yubico is 3rd party to Amazon)

* Hardware Key Fob MFA device
        Example: It's from Gemalto (3rd party)

* Hardware Key Fob MFA device for AWS GovCloud (US)
        Example: It's from SurePassID (3rd party)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three ways users can access AWS:

* AWS Management console (Password + MFA)
* AWS CLI (Protected by Access and secret Keys)
* AWS Software Development Kit (SDK) (For Code: Protected by Access and secret Keys)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two IAM Security Tools:

* IAM Credentials Report (Account-level)
        --> A report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials.

* IAM Access Advisor (User-level)
        --> It shows the service permissions granted to the user and when those services were last used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EC2 mainly consists in the capability of following:

* Renting virtual machines (EC2)
* Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
* Distributing load across machines (ELB)
* Scaling services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seven types of EC2 Instances:

* General Purpose
        --> Great for a diversity of workloads such as webservers or code repositories.
        --> These are great balance between Compute, Memory and Networking.

* Compute Optimized
        -> Great for compute intensive tasks which requires high performance processors such as below.
                # Batch processing workloads
                # Media transcoding
                # High performance webservers
                # High performance computing
                # Scientific modeling and machine learning
                # Dedicated gaming servers

* Memory Optimized
        -> Great for fast performance for workloads that process large sets of memory. 
        -> Following are use cases
                # High performance, Relational/Non-Relational databses
                # Distributed web scale cache stores
                # In-memory databases optimized for BI (Business Intelligence)
                # Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data

* Storage Optimized
        -> Great for storage intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write to large data sets on local      storage.
        -> Following are use cases
                # High frequesncy online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.
                # Relational and NoSQL databases
                # Cache for In-memory databases (Ex: Redis)
                # Data warehousing applications
                # Distributing file systems

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EBS snapshot Features:

1) EBS Snapshot Archive
        * Move a snapshot to an "archive tier" that is 75% cheaper 
        * It takes 24hrs to 72hrs to restore from archive

2) Recycle bin for EBS Snapshots
        * Setup rules to retain deleted snapshops so you can recover them after an accidental deletion.
