Three main deployment models of cloud:

-> Private Cloud
-> Public Cloud
-> Hybrid Cloud

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Five characteristics of Cloud computing:

-> On-demand Selfservice
-> Broad Network Access 
-> Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
-> Rapid elasticity and scalability
-> Measured units

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Six advantages of cloud computing:

-> Trade capital expense(CAPEX) over operational expence(OPEX) 
-> Benefit from massive economies of scale
-> stop guessing capacity
-> Increase speed and agility
-> Stop spending money running and maintaining the datacenters
-> Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Four different types of cloud computing:

-> infrastructure as a Service (Iaas) 
          Example from AWS : Ec2 instance
        Example from Others: Azure, GCP, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode

-> Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
          Example from AWS : Elastic Beanstalk
        Example from Others: Heroku, Google App Engine(GCP), Windows Azure(Microsoft)

-> Software as a Service (SaaS)
          Example from AWS : Many like Rekognition for Meachine Learning
        Example from Others: Google Apps(Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom

-> Function as a Service (Faas)
          Example from AWS : Lambda
        Example from Others: "Need to update"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three pricing fundamentals of Cloud (Pay-as-you-go):

Computing - Pay for compute time
Storage - Pay for on the amount of data stored
Netowrking - Pay only for amount of outgoing traffic i.e., from cloud.. Amount of Incoming traffic data is free

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to choose the region for Application deployment:

-> Based on Compliance with data governance and legal requirements
-> Proximity to customers: Reduced latency
-> Service availability in a choosen region
-> Pricing of the region

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Four MFA device options in AWS:

-> Virtual MFA device 
        Example: Google Authenticator from Google
                 Authy from AWS 
                
-> Universal 2nd Factor(U2F) Security Key
        Example: Yubikey from Yubico (Yubico is 3rd party to Amazon)

-> Hardware Key Fob MFA device
        Example: It's from Gemalto (3rd party)

-> Hardware Key Fob MFA device for AWS GovCloud (US)
        Example: It's from SurePassID (3rd party)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three ways users can access AWS:

-> AWS Management console (Password + MFA)
-> AWS CLI (Protected by Access and secret Keys)
-> AWS Software Development Kit (SDK) (For Code: Protected by Access and secret Keys)
