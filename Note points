Three main deployment models of cloud:

* Private Cloud
* Public Cloud
* Hybrid Cloud

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Five characteristics of Cloud computing:

* On-demand Selfservice
* Broad Network Access 
* Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
* Rapid elasticity and scalability
* Measured units

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Six advantages of cloud computing:

* Trade capital expense(CAPEX) over operational expence(OPEX) 
* Benefit from massive economies of scale
* stop guessing capacity
* Increase speed and agility
* Stop spending money running and maintaining the datacenters
* Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Four different types of cloud computing:

* infrastructure as a Service (Iaas) 
          Example from AWS : Ec2 instance
        Example from Others: Azure, GCP, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode

* Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
          Example from AWS : Elastic Beanstalk
        Example from Others: Heroku, Google App Engine(GCP), Windows Azure(Microsoft)

* Software as a Service (SaaS)
          Example from AWS : Many like Rekognition for Meachine Learning
        Example from Others: Google Apps(Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom

* Function as a Service (Faas)
          Example from AWS : Lambda
        Example from Others: "Need to update"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three pricing fundamentals of Cloud (Pay-as-you-go):

Computing - Pay for compute time
Storage - Pay for on the amount of data stored
Netowrking - Pay only for amount of outgoing traffic i.e., from cloud.. Amount of Incoming traffic data is free

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to choose the region for Application deployment:

* Based on Compliance with data governance and legal requirements
* Proximity to customers: Reduced latency
* Service availability in a choosen region
* Pricing of the region

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Four MFA device options in AWS:

* Virtual MFA device 
        Example: Google Authenticator from Google
                 Authy from AWS 
                
* Universal 2nd Factor(U2F) Security Key
        Example: Yubikey from Yubico (Yubico is 3rd party to Amazon)

* Hardware Key Fob MFA device
        Example: It's from Gemalto (3rd party)

* Hardware Key Fob MFA device for AWS GovCloud (US)
        Example: It's from SurePassID (3rd party)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three ways users can access AWS:

* AWS Management console (Password + MFA)
* AWS CLI (Protected by Access and secret Keys)
* AWS Software Development Kit (SDK) (For Code: Protected by Access and secret Keys)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two IAM Security Tools:

* IAM Credentials Report (Account-level)
        --> A report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials.

* IAM Access Advisor (User-level)
        --> It shows the service permissions granted to the user and when those services were last used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EC2 mainly consists in the capability of following:

* Renting virtual machines (EC2)
* Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
* Distributing load across machines (ELB)
* Scaling services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seven types of EC2 Instances:

* General Purpose
        --> Great for a diversity of workloads such as webservers or code repositories.
        --> These are great balance between Compute, Memory and Networking.

* Compute Optimized
        -> Great for compute intensive tasks which requires high performance processors such as below.
                # Batch processing workloads
                # Media transcoding
                # High performance webservers
                # High performance computing
                # Scientific modeling and machine learning
                # Dedicated gaming servers

* Memory Optimized
        -> Great for fast performance for workloads that process large sets of memory. 
        -> Following are use cases
                # High performance, Relational/Non-Relational databses
                # Distributed web scale cache stores
                # In-memory databases optimized for BI (Business Intelligence)
                # Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data

* Storage Optimized
        -> Great for storage intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write to large data sets on local      storage.
        -> Following are use cases
                # High frequesncy online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.
                # Relational and NoSQL databases
                # Cache for In-memory databases (Ex: Redis)
                # Data warehousing applications
                # Distributing file systems

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EBS snapshot Features:

1) EBS Snapshot Archive
        * Move a snapshot to an "archive tier" that is 75% cheaper 
        * It takes 24hrs to 72hrs to restore from archive

2) Recycle bin for EBS Snapshots
        * Setup rules to retain deleted snapshops so you can recover them after an accidental deletion.
        * Specify retention (from 1 day to 1 year)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Amazon S3 usecases:

1) Backup and Storage
2) Disaster Recovery
3) Archive
4) Hybrid Cloud Storage
5) Application hosting
6) Media hosting
7) Data lakes and Big data analysis
8) Software delivery
9) Static website
